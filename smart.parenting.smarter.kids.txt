ch 1. our children's amazing brains
   a. attention system: 
      i. reactive attention: 
      	 -> located deeply within brain's emotional center;
	 -> automatic, instinctive and involuntary;
	 -> automatically focussing attention to something moving or stimulating in the environment because ancestors need to watch out constantly for danger.
      ii. focused attention:
      	 -> located within prefontal cortex or the executive center, right behind our forehead;
	 -> non-automatic;
	 -> only developed with a lot of practice;
	 -> important because we need focused attention to learn things that are not naturally stimulating and exciting.
